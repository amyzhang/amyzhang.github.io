I am a PhD candidate at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, co-supervised by Joelle Pineau and Doina Precup, and a member of Facebook AI Research. I work on state abstractions, model-based reinforcement learning, representation learning, and generalization in RL. I have an M.Eng. in EECS and dual B.Sci. degrees in Mathematics and EECS from MIT.
