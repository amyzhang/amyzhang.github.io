I am an assistant professor at UT Austin in the Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My group, [Machine Intelligence through Decision-making and Interaction (MIDI) Lab](https://midi-lab.github.io/), focuses on theory and algorithms for sequential decision-making problems, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and representation learning, with a focus on improving robustness, generalization, and sample efficiency. I did my PhD at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, co-supervised by Joelle Pineau and Doina Precup. I also have an M.Eng. in EECS and dual B.Sci. degrees in Mathematics and EECS from MIT. Here is a recent [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aYqW2xMu3Z-o0usVkbcYq1l1b1palx9o/view?usp=sharing).
