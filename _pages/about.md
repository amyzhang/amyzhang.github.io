I am an assistant professor at UT Austin in the Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My group, Machine Intelligence through Decision-making and Interaction (MIDI) Lab, focuses on theory and algorithms for sequential decision-making problems, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and representation learning, with a focus on improving robustness, generalization, and sample efficiency. I did my PhD at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, co-supervised by Joelle Pineau and Doina Precup. I also have an M.Eng. in EECS and dual B.Sci. degrees in Mathematics and EECS from MIT.
